description: "WalletConnect for POS is an SDK that lets customers accept stablecoin payments with a checkout experience on par with NFC tap‑to‑pay. The SDK handles WalletConnect session lifecycles, building blockchain specific transactions, UI callbacks and transaction verification."
sidebarTitle: "Kotlin - POS SDK"

## User flow

1. Cashier selects “Pay with Crypto” on the POS.
2. Customer chooses token and network on the POS (e.g., USDC on Solana/Ethereum).
3. POS shows a WalletConnect QR. 
4. Customer scans with their wallet; session is established.
5. POS requests the payment. 
6. Wallet displays amount and the customer approves. 
7. The transaction is broadcasted by the wallet.
8. POS shows confirmation

## SDK Methods

The WalletConnect POS SDK exposes methods and callbacks to create smooth payment flows.

<Note>
The methods here are shown in isolation, for a full guide on how to use them follow to the step by step guide at the bottom.
</Note>

### Initialization

To initialize the SDK you have to call the initialize method with the `initParams`

```kotlin
POSClient.initialize(
      init = POS.Params.Init,
      onSuccess = { /*ready*/ },
      onError = { e -> /*error*/ }
)
```

Where the `POS.Params.Init` are as follow

```kotlin
 val projectId = "your_project_id" // Obtain your project ID from the dashboard.reown.com
 val metaData = MetaData(
   merchantName = "Name of Merchant",
   description = "Short Description",
   url = "url_web_page",
   icons = listOf("https://example.com/icon.png")
 )

 val initParams = Init(
	 projectId = projectId,
	 deviceId = "unique_device_id"
	 metaData = metadata,
	 application = this
 )
```

### Payment Intent

A payment intent is the server-side entity that specifies exactly what must be paid `(asset, chain, amount)` and how we will validate it.

```kotlin
POSClient.createPaymentIntent(intents: List<PaymentIntent>)
```

Where the `PaymentIntent` has the following fields:

```kotlin
data class PaymentIntent(
    var token: Token,
    val amount: String,
    val recipient: String
)
							
data class Token(
    val network: Network,
    val symbol: String,
    val standard: String,
    val address: String
)

data class Network(
    val name: String,
    val chainId: String
)
```

**What it does under the hood:**

- Generates the connection URL
- Sends the connection proposal to the wallet
- Awaits the connection result
- Builds and sends the transaction to the wallet
- Awaits the transaction result from the wallet
- Checks the transaction status

### Payment intent life cycle

The WalletConnect POS comes with a set of different UI events that allow to adapt the POS UI depending on the status of the payment.

```kotlin
   sealed interface PaymentEvent {
            data class QrReady(val uri: URI) : PaymentEvent
            data object Connected : PaymentEvent
            data object ConnectionRejected : PaymentEvent
            data class ConnectionFailed(val error: Throwable) : PaymentEvent
            data object PaymentRequested : PaymentEvent
            data object PaymentBroadcasted : PaymentEvent
            data class PaymentRejected(val message: String) : PaymentEvent
            data class PaymentSuccessful(val result: Any, val recipient: String) : PaymentEvent
            data class Error(val error: Throwable) : PaymentEvent
    }

fun interface POSDelegate {
  fun onEvent(event: POS.Model.PaymentEvent)
}

POSClient.setDelegate(POSDelegate)
```

## How to Integrate the POS SDK

Below are the steps to integrate the Kotlin POS SDK into your project.

### Sequence Diagram

![img](/images/pos-mermaid-diagram.png)

### Prerequisites

To use the POS SDK you will need the following:

- **Project ID** from the Reown Dashboard ([dashboard.reown.com](http://dashboard.reown.com)) .
- **Latest SDKs** (Reown Kotlin): https://github.com/reown-com/reown-kotlin/releases
- **Requirements:** Android min SDK 23

<Note>
    IMPORTANT: The WalletConnect POS is not available to download yet.
</Note>

### Integration Steps

<Steps>

<Step title="Add the Kotlin POS SDK dependencies" titleSize="h3">

First, add the dependencies to your project's `build.gradle.kts` file as shown below:

```kotlin /app/build.gradle.kts
dependencies {
  implementation(platform("com.reown:android-bom:<latest>"))
  implementation("com.reown:android-core")
  implementation("com.reown:pos")
}

```

</Step>

<Step title="Initialize the POS client" titleSize="h3">

```kotlin
//The Application class of your project
class MyApp : Application() {
  override fun onCreate() {
    super.onCreate()

    val projectId = "your_project_id"
    val metaData = MetaData(
      merchantName = "Name of Merchant",
      description = "Short Description",
      url = "url_web_page",
      icons = listOf("https://example.com/icon.png")
    )

    val initParams = Pos.Params.Init(
	    projectId = projectId,
	    deviceId = "unique_device_id"
	    metaData = metadata,
	    application = this
    )
    
    POSClient.initialize(
      init = initParams,
      onSuccess = { /*ready*/ },
      onError = { e -> /*error*/ }
    )
  }
}
```
</Step>

<Step title="Wire the UI" titleSize="h3">

It's important that you register the UI callbacks and delegate them before triggering a payment, or you risk missing early events like  `onQRShow`.

```kotlin
POSClient.setDelegate(object : POSDelegate {
	override fun onEvent(event: POS.Model.PaymentEvent) {  
			//TODO: handle events
     }
	
}
```
</Step>

<Step title="Initiate the payment" titleSize="h3">

Now, you can create a payment intent and initiate the payment.

```kotlin
val intents = listOf(
	PaymentIntent(
	      token = POS.Model.Token(
          network = POS.Model.Network(
                        chainId = "eip155:1",
                        name = "Ethereum"
                  ),
          standard = "erc20",
          symbol = "USDC",
          address = "0x1234"
                        ),
        amount = "1",
        recipient = "0x12345565"
      )
)
POSClient.createPaymentIntent(paymentIntents: List<PaymentIntent>)
```
</Step>

<Step title="Render QR code and connect" titleSize="h3">

Use `onQRShow(uri)` to render the WalletConnect QR; on successful session you’ll receive 
`Connected` you can use this state to show a loading spinner indicating that the payment request will follow. 

**Projects need to create their own UI.**

</Step>

<Step title="Send Transaction and observe status" titleSize="h3">

The SDK takes care of sending the transaction and depending on the status it will trigger different life-cycle events

- `PaymentRequested` → wallet prompt shown to the user
- `PaymentBroadcasted` → tx broadcasted
- `PaymentSuccessful`  → tx confirmed
- `Error(val error: Throwable)` → tx failed to complete

Depending on the different status is recommended to adapt the UI to show feedback to the user.
