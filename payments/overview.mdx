Digital payments across blockchains remain inconsistent. Each wallet, merchant, and provider implements its own integration model. This fragmentation slows innovation and limits interoperability. To address this, WalletConnect introduces the **`wallet_pay`** standard. A unified protocol for initiating and processing blockchain-based payments.

## What is `wallet_pay`

`wallet_pay` is the open standard that defines how wallets and payment applications communicate to initiate and process blockchain-based payments.
It provides a consistent way to describe payment requests: who is paying, what asset is being transferred, and under what conditions; regardless of wallet, blockchain, or application context.

At its core, `wallet_pay` enables **interoperable, wallet-native payments** across the entire WalletConnect ecosystem and beyond.

## Why a Standard Matters

Payment interactions between wallets and merchants have often been **fragmented**, each relying on custom APIs, message formats, or user flows.  

This lack of alignment makes it difficult for wallets, service providers, and merchants to work together at scale.

`wallet_pay` introduces a **shared language** for payments, allowing:

- **Wallets** to interpret any standardized payment request without bespoke integration.  
- **Merchants and service providers** to issue payment requests compatible with any wallet that supports the standard.  
- **Ecosystem scalability** for new payment contexts (online checkout, recurring payments, point-of-sale, etc.) can all use the same foundation.

In short, `wallet_pay` abstracts *how* payment information is exchanged, so innovation can focus on *what* experiences are built on top.

## Who Should Use `wallet_pay`

| Stakeholder | How They Benefit |
|--------------|------------------|
| **Wallet developers** | Implement a unified payments interface that works across merchants and ecosystems. |
| **Payment Service Providers (PSPs)** | Use the standard as a bridge between wallets, merchants, and on-chain settlement logic. |
| **Merchants & Platforms** | Integrate once and accept payments from any `wallet_pay`-compatible wallet. |
| **Consumer Apps for Payments (POS, web checkout, invoices, subscriptions)** | Build new payment experiences using a common protocol. |

<Note>
    While CAIP-358 primarily defines wallet-to-merchant interaction, it is extensible to PSPs that relay or implement those interactions.

## Role in the WalletConnect Payments Ecosystem

Within WalletConnect, `wallet_pay` serves as the **foundational protocol** that powers all payment-related features.  

Every SDK or product, such as the **POS SDK**, implements or extends `wallet_pay` to handle request creation, signing, and transaction tracking in a consistent way.

This means that any wallet or merchant integrating `wallet_pay` is automatically compatible with the full WalletConnect Payments ecosystem, present and future.

## Specification Reference

The `wallet_pay` standard is defined in [CAIP-358: Universal Payment Request Method](https://eip.tools/caip/358). It specifies how payment requests are structured and exchanged between merchants and wallets. Lifecycle management and status tracking (e.g., pending, confirmed, failed) are implementation details defined by [WalletConnect’s POS SDK](/payments/point-of-sale).
