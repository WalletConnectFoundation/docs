Digital payments across blockchains remain inconsistent. Payments are fragmented by geography and <Tooltip headline="Rail" tip="The term for the payment network that is used to process payments.">Rail</Tooltip>. For example, a few countries in Latin America run on PIX and Mercado Pago, Europe on SEPA and cards, Southeast Asia on QR wallets like GrabPay and GCash, China on Alipay and WeChat Pay, India on UPI. 

Each region invented its own system, none of them interoperate, and merchants and PSPs are forced to support whatever their local stack dictates. Users adapt to the rail in front of them rather than the method they prefer.

In the world of Crypto payments, each wallet, merchant, and provider implements its own integration model. This fragmentation slows innovation and limits interoperability. 

To address this, WalletConnect introduces the **WalletConnect Pay**. 

**WalletConnect Pay** provides a complete end-to-end crypto payment solution that fits directly into an existing Payment Service Provider (PSP) stack, allowing crypto payments to be offered without changing how payments operate today. 

## How can I as a PSP use or integrate WalletConnect Pay?

As a Payment Service Provider (PSP), you can use the POS (Point of Sale) SDK to integrate WalletConnect Pay into your existing payment stack. This allows you to offer your merchants and customers an option to accept crypto payments without changing how payments operate today.

If you are a PSP and want to learn more about WalletConnect Pay and its offerings, please reach out to sales@walletconnect.com.

## What would WalletConnect Pay look like in action?

WalletConnect Pay would live inside the POS device that a merchant uses to accept day-to-day payments. The flow would be as follows:

1. The merchant selects "Pay with Crypto" on the POS device.
2. The POS device generates a WalletConnect QR with the payment intent.
3. The customer scans the QR with their wallet:
   - The wallet displays the payment intent.
   - The customer picks the token and network of their choice (e.g., USDC on Ethereum) and approves the payment.
   - The wallet builds the transaction and sends it to the network.

4. Or alternatively, the customer scams the QR code with their QR scanner:
    - This takes the customer to a payment gateway URL that is pre-filled with the payment intent.
    - The customer can connect their wallet (using WalletConnect).
    - The wallet displays the payment intent.
    - The customer picks the token and network of their choice (e.g., USDC on Ethereum) and approves the payment.
    - The wallet builds the transaction and sends it to the network.
5. The POS device receives the transaction result and displays it to the customer.
6. The merchant then receives fiat or crypto settlement from the PSP.
