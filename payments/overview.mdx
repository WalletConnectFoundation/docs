The **WalletConnect POS SDK** extends the open WalletConnect protocol into the world of **in-person payments**, enabling seamless, stablecoin-native checkout experiences at physical points of sale.

With the same universal interoperability that connects wallets and dapps, the POS SDK allows **Payment Service Providers (PSPs)** and **merchants** to accept stablecoin payments across multiple chains and wallets, no hardware changes or fragmented integrations required.

---

## Overview

The **WalletConnect POS SDK** brings the simplicity of “tap-to-pay” to crypto. Using a QR-based flow, any wallet connected through WalletConnect can make real-world payments in seconds.

- **Merchant:** Selects “Crypto Payment” → POS generates a payment QR  
- **Customer:** Scans with their wallet → confirms transaction  
- **POS:** Receives instant onchain confirmation and marks payment complete  

This SDK bridges online crypto rails with in-person commerce, making **stablecoin payments** as frictionless as any traditional payment method.

## Why WalletConnect POS SDK?

Stablecoins have become the dominant onchain payment medium with **$4T+ monthly transaction volume**, yet real-world checkout remains fragmented:

- Merchants must integrate multiple wallets or blockchains individually  
- PSPs lack visibility into transaction states and reconciliation  
- Customers face confusing UX with manual address entry and gas settings

As providers like **Visa**, **PayPal**, and **Stripe** experiment with stablecoin settlements, the next step is **real-world adoption**, where crypto payments feel native at the register.

**WalletConnect POS SDK turns that vision into reality**.

## What does WalletConnect POS SDK have to offer?

<Steps>
    <Step title="Universal Rail" icon="globe">
        A single SDK for PSPs and merchants to **accept stablecoin payments across any WalletConnect-compatible wallet and supported network**. No separate wallet integrations or new hardware required.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Seamless Checkout UX" icon="qrcode">
        Customers simply scan, confirm, and pay. Payments settle onchain in seconds with a **familiar checkout experience** similar to Apple Pay or tap-to-pay.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Multi-Chain with Full Visibility" icon="ethernet">
        Supports **EVM, Solana, and Tron** from day one. Provides standardized transaction statuses for reconciliation and customer support:
        
        `[new, pending_onchain, confirmed, underpaid, overpaid, expired, failed]`.
    </Step>
</Steps>

### Merchant - Point of Sale (POS)
1. Selects **Crypto** as payment method.
2. Chooses **token** (e.g., USDC, USDT).
3. Chooses **network** (e.g., Base, Polygon, Ethereum).
4. POS **generates QR** with payment details (amount, token, network, destination).

### Customer (Wallet)
1. **Scans the QR** using a WalletConnect-compatible wallet.
2. Wallet displays **payment preview**.
3. Customer **confirms** the transaction.
4. Transaction broadcasts onchain.

### Completion
- POS receives confirmation and displays success/receipt  
- Transaction hash available for tracking and reconciliation  

**This flow can also be simplified to a one-step scan for pre-filled requests.** This is coming soon and more information will be available shortly.

## Who is it for?

### Payment Service Providers & POS Integrators

**DTC Pay**, Square-like or Ingenico-style providers are examples of PSPs that can use the POS SDK to accept stablecoin payments.

- Reduce cost and complexity of integrating stablecoin payments  
- Gain transaction lifecycle visibility for **refunds and reconciliation**  
- Stay competitive as stablecoin adoption enters mainstream retail  

<Warning>
WalletConnect POS SDK does not handle refunds or reconciliation directly. It is the responsibility of the PSP to handle these. However, the SDK provides the necessary standardized callbacks to allow the PSP to handle the refund and reconciliation process.
</Warning>

### Merchants
- Accept stablecoins from any wallet with no new hardware  
- Offer customers a **fast, modern checkout** experience  
- Maintain compliance and reporting via PSP dashboards
