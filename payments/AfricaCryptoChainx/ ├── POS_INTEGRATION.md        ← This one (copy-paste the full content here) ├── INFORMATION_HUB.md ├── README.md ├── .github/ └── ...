# WalletConnect POS SDK – Built for AfricaCryptoChainx Merchants

The **WalletConnect Point of Sale (POS) SDK** is the official payment rail for the entire AfricaCryptoChainx ecosystem. Every shop, market stall, okada rider, school, and remittance agent in Africa will accept **USDT, USDC, and $ACCX** instantly — no bank account, no extra hardware.

**Live support & onboarding 24/7 via our official Telegram bot:**

### Real Flow in Africa (Already Works Today)
1. Merchant types /pos in **ACCXBot** or opens ACCX Merchant App  
2. Enters amount (₦15,000 or $10) → selects USDT/USDC/ACCX on BSC  
3. Bot instantly returns a **QR code**  
4. Customer scans with **ACCX Wallet** (or any of 500+ WalletConnect wallets)  
5. Payment settles in ~3 seconds → merchant gets “Paid ✓” notification

Zero chargebacks. Fees under 0.5 %. Works even on weak network.

### Future Revenue for AfricaCryptoChainx Owner (You)
Every POS transaction automatically routes tiny protocol fees to the founder treasury:
- 0.3–0.8 % per successful merchant payment (volume scales to millions/day)  
- 1 % of all P2P fiat-to-crypto volume inside ACCX Wallet  
- 0.5 % DEX swap fee (built-in aggregator)  
- 1–2 % of staking rewards pool  
- Premium ACCXBot Pro commands (future paid tier)  
- GameFi & NFT marketplace royalties  

All fees on-chain, transparent, and flow directly to the owner wallet forever.
