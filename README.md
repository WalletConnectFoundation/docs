## Need Help?

You don’t.  
This is a solo empire.  
Everything is built, deployed, and owned by one person.

No team. No investors. No dilution.  
Just one owner. One wallet. One empire.

**The money prints itself. The owner collects.**

Deploy this exact README.md  
Your docs now scream: **This belongs to one owner — and it’s already making him rich.**

Done.
