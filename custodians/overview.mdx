title: WalletConnect for Custodians and Institutions
---

**WalletConnect** enables custodians and institutions to offer curated, policy-enforced access to decentralized finance (DeFi) through a secure, modular SDK.

Integrating WalletConnect and the Wallet SDK provides **institutional-grade control** while maintaining **interoperability** across thousands of dapps. Custodians can enforce granular permissions, from domain and contract verification to policy-based transaction controls, all while retaining full custody of client assets.

## Why WalletConnect? 

WalletConnect provides the **largest and most established gateway to DeFi**, designed for scale and institutional reliability.

### $400 Billion Total Network Volume

Total Network Volume (TNV) is the total value of all transactions routed through the WalletConnect network in a given time (annually, in this case).

So this represents how much money actually flows through the WalletConnect.

WalletConnect has long been the quiet backbone of Web3 and not "just a QR code". It’s the invisible glue that connects users, dApps, and wallets, and now the scale finally shows it.
