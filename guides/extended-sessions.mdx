title: Extended WalletConnect Sessions Request
---

This guide will walk you through how a wallet developer can customize the session request expiry in WalletConnect using the **`expiry`** parameter.

## Extended Session Expiry - what does it mean?

When an app sends a request through WalletConnect (for example, a signature request), it stays “active” until the expiry time is reached. If the wallet does not respond before the expiry, the request automatically fails with a timeout.

By default, the expiry is short, i.e., 5 minutes. Extending the session expiry time allows the wallet and app to keep the request open longer, **up to 7 days**. This is useful for cases like off-hours approvals, delayed custody flows, or multi-party signing.

### What do wallets need to do?

A wallet must:
- Maintain pending state until expiry or completion.
- Gracefully discard expired requests.
- Verify user intent remains valid after long delays.

### Limits

- **Minimum:** 300 seconds (5 min)
- **Maximum:** 604,800 seconds (7 days)

## How can I extend the session request expiry as a wallet? 

Wallets must correctly interpret and enforce the expiry.

- Parse `expiry` in seconds from incoming request metadata.
- Keep pending requests active until they’re resolved or the expiry time elapses.
- Notify the user of pending and expired requests.
- If the expiry has passed, return an error response (`code: 4100`, “Request expired”).
- Optional UX: display countdown timers or “expires in X hours”.
