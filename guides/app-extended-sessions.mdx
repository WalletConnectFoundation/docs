title: Extended WalletConnect Sessions Request for Apps
---

This guide will walk you through how an app developer can customize the session request expiry in WalletConnect using the **`expiry`** parameter.

## Extended Session Expiry - what does it mean?

When an app sends a request through WalletConnect (for example, a signature request), it stays “active” until the expiry time is reached. If the wallet does not respond before the expiry, the request automatically fails with a timeout.

By default, the expiry is short, i.e., 5 minutes. Extending the session expiry time allows the wallet and app to keep the request open longer, **up to 7 days**. This is useful for cases like off-hours approvals, delayed custody flows, or multi-party signing.

### What do apps need to do?

An app must:

- Keep track of outstanding requests and handle delayed responses.
- Have a UI that tolerates waiting for a response as long as the expiry is configured.

Extended durations may not be suitable for **time-bounded actions** (e.g., swaps with quotes, flash opportunities) where blockchain state changes invalidate the request. 

Hence an app must align **WalletConnect expiry** with any **contract-level expiry** to avoid mismatched timing.

### Limits

- **Minimum:** 300 seconds (5 min)
- **Maximum:** 604,800 seconds (7 days)

## How can I extend the session request expiry as an app? 

Developers can define how long a WalletConnect session request remains active by using the **`expiry`** parameter in the session request payload.

### Parameter

`expiry`: Optional field to set session expiry time. Must be in seconds.

### Implementation

Below are the examples of how to implement the `expiry` parameter in the session request payload for different providers.

<CodeGroup>  
    ```javascript Sign Client
    const result = await signClient.request({
        topic: 'xyz',
        request: {
          method: 'personal_sign',
          params: [
            '0xdeadbeef',
            '0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dead'
          ]
        },
        chainId: 'eip155:1',
        expiry: 600 // <-- add this for 10 minutes expiry in seconds
    });
    ```
    ```javascript Universal Provider
    const result = await universalProvider.request(
        {
          method: "personal_sign",
          params: ["0xdeadbeef", "0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dead"],
        },
        "eip155:1",
        600, // <-- add this for 10 minutes expiry in seconds
      );
    ```
    ```javascript Ethereum Provider
    await ethereumProvider.request(
      {
        method: "personal_sign",
        params: ["0xdeadbeef", "0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dead"],
      },
      600, // <-- add this for 10 minutes expiry in seconds
    );
    ```

**Apps should store pending request IDs in local storage to handle delayed responses, app reload or crash scenarios.**
