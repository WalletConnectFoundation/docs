## Pre-requisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:
- An Optimism compatible wallet connected to the OP mainnet
- For a list of supported wallets, visit: [WalletConnect Guide - OP Wallets](https://walletguide.walletconnect.network/?chains=eip155%3A10)

## Security Checks

Before claiming, always verify:
- The domain matches WalletConnect's official domain [airdrop.walletconnect.network](https://airdrop.walletconnect.network)
- The airdrop contract address matches the official one [`0x4ee97a759AACa2EdF9c1445223b6Cd17c2eD3fb4`](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x4ee97a759AACa2EdF9c1445223b6Cd17c2eD3fb4)

<Note>
Common claim failures may occur due to:
- Transaction failure (network issues)
- Insufficient gas (WalletConnect will subsidize gas fees, however, due to variable network conditions, the subsidized amount may not cover the complete gas fee. If you encounter high network congestion, we recommend waiting until network activity decreases)
</Note>

## Support

### I'm having trouble claiming my tokens

If you're unable to claim your WCT airdrop, you can opt to receive your tokens through direct distribution instead of the standard claim process.

To use this alternative method:

1. Connect to your profile using the recipient address.
2. Click on the "Change Address" button.
3. Accept the terms and conditions.
4. Connect an OP mainnet wallet.

<Warning>
Once you choose this option, you won't be able to use the standard claim process, but you can update your provided address until the claim period ends.
</Warning>

The WalletConnect Foundation will send your tokens directly to this address on January 7th.

### I'm having trouble connecting my wallet

<Warning>
Some wallets (like Argent) don't support OP Mainnet. If you're using one of these wallets, you can't claim your tokens directly. Instead, you can set a recipient address to receive your tokens on January 7th.
</Warning>

If your wallet doesn't support OP Mainnet, you can:

1. Scroll to the page footer
2. Click "Issues Connecting"
3. Accept the terms and conditions and click 'Change Network'
4. Select Ethereum network in the popup module
5. Connect using WalletConnect

2. Set a new recipient address to recieve the airdrop on January 7th (must be OP Mainnet compatible)
