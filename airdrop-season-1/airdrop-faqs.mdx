## How will I know if I was eligible for the airdrop?

To verify eligibility, visit airdrop.walletconnect.network and connect your wallet(s).

- If you’re eligible, you’ll see a “Congratulations” message confirming your eligibility to claim the Season 1 airdrop.
- If not, a message will appear: “Unfortunately, you are not eligible for the Season 1 airdrop.”

If you weren’t eligible this time, you may still be eligible for future seasons of the WCT airdrop. To stay informed, simply enter your email here. Or alternatively keep an eye on WalletConnect X account

## How do I claim any WCT tokens I may be eligible for?

To check your eligibility for the airdrop, visit airdrop.walletconnect.network. Connect the wallet(s) you used to register for the airdrop. If you’re unsure which wallet you used, you’ll be able to try adding multiple wallets and see any eligible wallets in your dashboard when you connect.

Once connected, you’ll see a “Congratulations” message if you are eligible for the Season 1 airdrop. From there:

1. Claim Your Tokens: Select "Claim" to transfer your tokens to your wallet. WalletConnect will subsidize gas fees for the claims to help cover your transaction costs.
2. Stake Your Tokens (Recommended): Next, choose “Stake” to stake your tokens to the network and prepare for reward accrual.*

## Will claiming the WCT airdrop require gas fees?

Yes, a small gas fee will apply when claiming WCT tokens. The exact amount will depend on blockchain network conditions at the time of claiming. 

WalletConnect Foundation will subsidize the gas fees to help reduce your transaction costs. Please note that due to variable network conditions, the subsidized amount may not cover the complete gas fee. If you encounter high network congestion, we recommend waiting until network activity decreases to optimize your gas costs.

## Will there be future airdrops of WCT, and can I take part in the next airdrop?

Yes. 

WalletConnect will have additional airdrop seasons. While dates are not finalized, you can stay updated by [submitting your email](https://walletconnect-foundation.eo.page/newsletter) and following the WalletConnect [X account](https://x.com/WalletConnect).

## Can I transfer my WCT tokens immediately after claiming? 

No.

WCT tokens are non-transferable at this stage, as outlined in the [whitepaper](https://whitepaper.walletconnect.network/WalletConnect%20Whitepaper.pdf).

Non-transferability ensures that WCT tokens remain within the ecosystem to fulfill their intended purpose, supporting and enabling network functionality. For more details, refer to “Why is the WalletConnect Token (WCT) non-transferable?” question below.

While you are unable to transfer your token, you can stake them, which is encouraged. Once claimed, click  “Stake” to lock your tokens and prepare for reward accrual.


## Why can't I see my tokens in my wallet? 

Some wallets may not immediately support WCT after you claim it. This could be due to:

- Wallet ecosystem compatibility: The wallet you are using might not support the Optimism (OP) network.
- Token not whitelisted: The WCT token might not yet be added to the wallet's token list.

*How to Manually Add WCT to Your Wallet:*

Each wallet has its own method for adding tokens, but they typically require the same information. Here’s what you’ll need:

- Contract Address: 0xef4461891dfb3ac8572ccf7c794664a8dd927945
- Ticker: WCT
- Decimals: 18
- Network: Optimism (OP)

Check your wallet provider's instructions for adding custom tokens and input the above details to display your WCT balance.

## What happens if the address I used is with a wallet that doesn’t support the Optimism (OP) network? 

You will need to import the address used for the registration into a wallet that supports the Optimism (OP) network in order to be able to claim your WCT. You can find a list of wallets that support Optimism (OP) network [here](https://walletguide.walletconnect.network/?chains=eip155%3A10). 

## How long do I have to claim my tokens?

You have until 3rd January 2025 to claim your season 1 airdrop. Tokens not claimed by this date will be added back to Token pools for subsequent airdrop seasons or similar initiatives.

## How do I stake my tokens?

If you were eligible for the airdrop, you will have claimed your tokens. 

To stake: Connect the wallet(s) holding your WCT. And your dashboard will appear.

Next, choose “Stake” to stake your tokens to the network and accrue rewards. You will be able to choose the amount of tokens you wish to stake and the duration (minimum 1 week and maximum of 2 years).

[See the step by step here](/wct-staking/overview)

## When will rewards start?

Rewards will start accruing on December 19, 2024, immediately after the token distribution process completes its first stage. At that point, all eligible stakers will begin to accrue rewards automatically, with no additional action required.

## What is the WalletConnect Token (WCT)?

The WalletConnect Token is the native token of the WalletConnect Network.

The four utilities of the WCT are:

- Fees: Used to pay for network services like relay usage.*
- Rewards: Tokens are distributed as incentives to keep the network secure and efficient.
- Staking: WCT holders can stake tokens to accrue rewards.
- Governance: WCT holders can vote on proposals and updates, giving the community control over the network’s development through decentralized governance.*

*Governance and fees features are expected to be enabled after approval by WCT tokenholders.

## Why is the WalletConnect Token (WCT) non-transferable?

There are several reasons including:

Network Functionality: The purpose of WCT is to support and enable network functionality. By restricting transferability at launch, the tokens will remain within the ecosystem to serve their intended purpose.

Long-Term Focus: This purpose for WCT and restriction on transferability allows the prioritization of the long-term development and stability of the WalletConnect Network. Non-transferability provides an opportunity to thoroughly test all token functionalities, including staking, governance and mechanisms, before introducing transferability.

Ecosystem Development: This non-transferability period serves as the starting point for creating and nurturing the WalletConnect ecosystem, allowing participants to engage with the Network's core functionalities.

Infrastructure Protection: As a key piece of web3 infrastructure, the WalletConnect Network must be stable and secure. This non-transferability period mitigates potential risks associated with premature token transferability.

The WalletConnect Foundation will facilitate discussions within the community about enabling transferability of the WCT token, and transferability enablement will be determined via proposal and approval by voting WCT token holders. The transition to full transferability will be carefully managed and based on specific, community-agreed milestones that indicate the Network's readiness. 

## What can I do with the WalletConnect Token (WCT)?

Token holders will be able to participate in network activity like governance and staking, but cannot transfer their tokens to other wallets. The WCT token contributes to network functionality, elements of which – like governance and fees – will become active as the network continues along its targeted decentralization roadmap in 2025. The determination to unlock transferability of the token will work alongside this targeted roadmap intended for optimal network performance for all of its contributors and community members. For more information on token utility and the possibilities as it relates to community governance and collaboration [please see the whitepaper.](https://whitepaper.walletconnect.network/WalletConnect%20Whitepaper.pdf)

## What was the eligibility criteria assessed for the airdrop?

There were two categories of eligibility criteria for the airdrop: 
1. Activity as a user
As a user, your activity across the Network including connections, signatures, and onchain activity will be assessed. Past activity both recently and overall with the WalletConnect Network factor into eligibility. Eligibility for users is assessed from wallet addresses added to the user’s profile.

2. Activity as a contributor
As a contributor, past contributions to the WalletConnect Network including projects spanning CAIPs, EIPs, Ethereum SDKs, non-EVM SDKs, and to open source projects that positively impact the onchain ecosystem factor into eligibility. Eligibility for contributors is assessed from Github accounts added to the user’s profile.

You may be eligible for the airdrop as both a user and a contributor within the same profile.

To ensure meaningful contributions are recognized, the Season 1 airdrop uses a retrospective snapshot of criteria spanning the network’s history, starting from its inception. Specifically, the snapshot covers:

- Onchain activity between June 12, 2024, and September 12, 2024
- WalletConnect usage and historical contributions up to September 12, 2024

This approach ensures that both early and active participants are fairly represented.

Activity after this date was not considered. Different criteria and timeframes may be relevant for subsequent airdrop seasons.

*Eligibility for the airdrop is determined by meeting criteria at certain thresholds. Meeting specific criteria alone does not guarantee eligibility for the airdrop.*

## Were all registered users eligible for the airdrop? 

No. 

Eligibility for the airdrop was determined by meeting certain criteria at certain thresholds. Meeting a specific criterion did not guarantee eligibility for the airdrop. To assess meaningful contributions, the retrospective snapshot of criteria for season 1 of the airdrop considers a timeframe from as early as the network’s inception, up to September 12, 2024 only. Activity after this date was not considered.

Various distribution models were applied, intended for fair allocation across all eligible participants. For example, users who met more criteria or had higher engagement might have received a proportionally larger share.

This information is in regard to season 1 of the WCT airdrop. Not meeting eligibility for season 1 does not preclude eligibility for following seasons. 

Please see the [scoring blog](https://walletconnect.network/blog/airdrop-how-scoring-works) for more information.

## Was anyone unable to participate?

The airdrop registration webpage is inaccessible from certain jurisdictions for compliance purposes, including sanctions regulations set forth by applicable agencies from the United States and other governments which prohibit providing products or services accessible from domains to persons in specific countries and territories. Further, digital wallet addresses identified on Specifically Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons Lists maintained by the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control may not participate. Wallet addresses that interacted with sanctioned parties, terrorist organizations or other serious criminal activity, as identified by onchain screening tools, were also ineligible for the airdrop. 

Please see the [Airdrop Terms & Conditions](https://airdrop.walletconnect.network/terms) for more details about sanctions compliance and eligibility. 

## If I am eligible for the airdrop, how many WCT tokens will I be able to claim?

The airdrop uses an internal scoring mechanism to determine if you are eligible to claim the airdrop and how many tokens you may receive. Your score is determined based on a combination of your past connections via the WalletConnect Network, signatures, and onchain activity. The more criteria you meet, the higher your score. The amount of tokens you may be eligible to claim is based on your score. However, users must exceed certain scoring thresholds to become eligible. Not all users who register will exceed these thresholds.

Tokens are allocated based on eligible users’ scores who exceed those certain thresholds, with eligible users who meet more criteria or have higher engagement receiving a proportionally larger share. Various distribution models may be applied designed for fair allocation across all eligible users.

*Meeting specific criteria alone does not guarantee eligibility for the airdrop. Please see the [Airdrop Terms and Conditions](https://airdrop.walletconnect.network/terms), or [scoring blog](https://walletconnect.network/blog/airdrop-how-scoring-works) for additional information.*

## What happens if I do not claim my tokens within the claims period?

If tokens are unclaimed within the claims period for season 1 of the WCT airdrop, those tokens may be added to allocations for future airdrop seasons.

## Why was I not eligible?

Eligibility for wallet addresses that passed certain screenings (see answer above to “Was anyone unable to participate?”) was based on various factors, including:

- Past interactions with the WalletConnect Network (QR code scans, signatures, and other network activity).
- Onchain activity associated with your wallet(s).
- Contributions to WalletConnect-related projects (GitHub contributions).

If you did not engage with the WalletConnect Network during the eligibility period, you may not be eligible for this season 1 airdrop.

## I missed or wasn't eligible for season 1 of the WCT airdrop – will there be more seasons?

There will be more seasons in the future. If you are not eligible this time or you missed it, you may be eligible for future seasons. Follow our socials and subscribe to emails to get notified about future seasons.

## How many tokens are being allocated in total for the airdrop?

50,000,000 WCT tokens will be distributed for season 1 of the WCT airdrop, out of a total 185,000,000 WCT tokens allocated in total for WCT airdrops.

Of the 50 million tokens allocated to the first season of the airdrop, a total of 30 million were reserved for users who registered a profile during the registration period for season 1 and met relevant criteria. Priority was given to users with consistent, high-quality engagement with the network so the airdrop distribution reflected meaningful past usage of the network. The remaining 20 million were reserved for network contributors, including Node Operators, Wallets, Apps, SDKs and early contributors (this including Gitcoin and Github contributors).
