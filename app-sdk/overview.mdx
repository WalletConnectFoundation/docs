## **Your Gateway to the WalletConnect Network**

<Note>
**We highly recommend using one of our SDK partners to integrate WalletConnect into your app.**
</Note>

The **WalletConnect App SDK** is the foundational gateway for apps to access the **WalletConnect Network,** the decentralized connectivity layer for the financial internet.

With a single integration, developers can connect to **700+ wallets** and **65,000+ apps** across **EVM, Solana, Bitcoin**, and **any network with a CAIP-25 namespace**, while preserving privacy, composability, and user choice.

**Built on open standards** and powered by a decentralized relay network, WalletConnect unlocks secure and cross-chain wallet connections for apps across devices and platforms.

Whether youâ€™re building for DeFi, gaming, payments, or identity, WalletConnect provides the essential building block for **trusted wallet-to-app experiences**, all backed by the **infrastructure that powers the financial internet**.

## **Powering leading SDKs across Web3**

The WalletConnect App SDK is already embedded in some of the most widely-used SDKs in the ecosystem - powering everything from onboarding to payments.

## **Who is it for?**

- **App developers** who want to connect wallets quickly and securely
- **SDK builders** who want a powerful foundation for wallet connectivity
- **Web3 platforms** scaling across chains and wallets

If your product needs to talk to wallets, the App SDK is your starting point.

## What does WalletConnect have to offer for Apps?

At its core, the WalletConnect handles the most critical UX layer of any onchain app: **wallet connection**.

âœ… **Prebuilt modal UX** for connecting wallets

âœ… **Chain-agnostic support** across EVM, Solana, Bitcoin, and more

âœ… **Built-in compatibility** with 500+ wallets

âœ… **Native, embedded UI** - no iframes, no redirects

âœ… **Customizable and composable** - use standalone or extend with your own flows

Itâ€™s the fastest way to build reliable wallet connectivity, with none of the versioning, RPC mismatches, or fragmented logic that plague homegrown solutions.

## How to Integrate WalletConnect into your App

There are **two core pathways to integrate WalletConnect** into your app:

1. Via an SDK partner that has already integrated WalletConnect into their SDK.
2. Standalone integration of WalletConnect.

Below, you can find instructions and information for both pathways.

## Integrate WalletConnect via an SDK Partner

First, we need to cover what exactly is an SDK and how projects can use them to integrate WalletConnect into their app.

### What is an SDK?

An SDK is a software development kit that provides a set of tools, libraries, and documentation for developers to build applications. It is a collection of code, tools, and resources that help developers build applications faster and easier.

In this context, SDKs are pre-packaged developer tools that abstract away the underlying protocol, i.e. WalletConnect, and provide a simplified integration path for apps and wallets, making wallet connectivity fast, reliable, and developer-friendly.

### ðŸ›  Most Popular SDKs built on top of WalletConnect

- [**Reown AppKit**](https://reown.com/appkit) - A modular UX engine for onboarding, payments, and wallet interaction. Used in 286M+ sessions and 10B+ RPC calls .
- [**Privy**](https://www.privy.io/) - Secure wallet infrastructure that simplifies identity, session handling, and embedded wallets.
- [**Dynamic**](https://www.dynamic.xyz/) - All-in-one authentication and wallet SDK for web3 apps across mobile and web.
- [**ConnectKit**](https://family.co/connectkit) - Beautiful React components built for WalletConnect connections.
- [**RainbowKit**](https://www.rainbowkit.com/) - Customizable wallet connection UI optimized for Ethereum and WalletConnect.

These SDKs demonstrate whatâ€™s possible with the App SDK as a base layer and how it can be extended to suit your product, stack, and user flow.

### SDK Chain Compatibility

Below you can find the chain compatibility for the most popular SDKs built on top of WalletConnect.
