## **Your Gateway to the WalletConnect Network**

The **WalletConnect App SDK** is the foundational gateway for apps to access the **WalletConnect Network,** the decentralized connectivity layer for the financial internet.

With a single integration, developers can connect to **700+ wallets** and **65,000+ apps** across **EVM, Solana, Bitcoin**, and **any network with a CAIP-25 namespace**, while preserving privacy, composability, and user choice.

Built on open standards and powered by a decentralized relay network, the App SDK unlocks secure, cross-chain wallet connections across devices and platforms.

Whether youâ€™re building for DeFi, gaming, payments, or identity, the App SDK provides the essential building block for trusted wallet-to-app experiences, all backed by the infrastructure that powers the financial internet.

## **What does the SDK do?**

At its core, the WalletConnect App SDK handles the most critical UX layer of any onchain app: **wallet connection**.

âœ… **Prebuilt modal UX** for connecting wallets

âœ… **Chain-agnostic support** across EVM, Solana, Bitcoin, and more

âœ… **Built-in compatibility** with 500+ wallets

âœ… **Native, embedded UI** - no iframes, no redirects

âœ… **Customizable and composable** - use standalone or extend with your own flows

Itâ€™s the fastest way to build reliable wallet connectivity, with none of the versioning, RPC mismatches, or fragmented logic that plague homegrown solutions.

## **Who is it for?**

- **App developers** who want to connect wallets quickly and securely
- **SDK builders** who want a powerful foundation for wallet connectivity
- **Web3 platforms** scaling across chains and wallets

If your product needs to talk to wallets, the App SDK is your starting point.
