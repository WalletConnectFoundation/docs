```markdown
Configure strict branch protection rules for main across all AfricaCryptoChainx repositories

- Require pull request before merging  
- Require 1 approving review  
- Require status checks to pass (Dependabot, Fortify AST, CodeQL)  
- Require linear history  
- Block force pushes  
- Allow direct pushes to main only for admins and project manager  
- Do not allow bypassing the above rules  
- Dismiss stale approvals on new commits  

This setup ensures:
- All code is reviewed and scanned for security
- No accidental or malicious history rewrites
- Full control for the project manager while maintaining transparency
- Consistent quality across the entire AfricaCryptoChainx ecosystem (wallet, ACCXBot, dApps, contracts)

Organization-level enforcement applied to every repository under Africacryptochainx-Com.
```
