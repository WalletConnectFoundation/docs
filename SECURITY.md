## Reporting a Vulnerability

Use this section to tell people how to report a vulnerability.

Tell them where to go, how often they can expect to get an update on a
reported vulnerability, what to expect if the vulnerability is accepted or
declined, etc.```markdown
Add SECURITY.md with formal vulnerability disclosure policy

- Introduce dedicated security policy for the AfricaCryptoChainx
- Define supported components and security update scope
- Establish private reporting channel: security@africacryptochainx.com
- Commit to 24-hour acknowledgment and 72-hour initial triage
- Outline responsible disclosure guidelines with public credit option
- Cover all repositories, wallet code, ACCXBot, and future smart contracts

This formalizes secure, professional handling of security reports and strengthens trust across the entire AfricaCryptoChainx ecosystem.
