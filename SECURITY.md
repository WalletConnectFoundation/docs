# SECURITY.md — AfricaCryptoChainx Owner-Level Access Control

**This file is permanently locked by the project owner.**

## Owner Full Control & Final Authority
AfricaCryptoChainx is a **founder-controlled, community-built** project.  
All critical decisions, treasury keys, upgrade rights, and final merge authority remain **exclusively** with the founder (@Patrickoto91 / AfricaCryptoChainx owner).

- Mainnet upgrade keys → owner-only multisig  
- Treasury & protocol fee wallet → owner-controlled  
- GitHub repository OWNER / ADMIN rights → single person (founder)  
- No timelock, no DAO, no committee can override owner decisions

This is intentional and will not change.

## Warning — Unauthorized Changes
Any attempt to:
- Remove or weaken owner-level controls
- Introduce hidden backdoors or logic bombs or malicious code
- Force DAO takeover or "community governance" without explicit owner consent
- Modify treasury/revenue flow away from founder wallet
- Perform unauthorized hard-fork or rug-style actions

…will be treated as a **hostile attack**.

Such pull requests will be immediately closed and the contributor permanently banned from all AfricaCryptoChainx repositories and community channels.
