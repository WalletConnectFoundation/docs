## Frequently Asked Questions

### How does staking work?

When you stake WCT, you lock tokens in the protocol to earn rewards and voting power.

Your position remains fully locked and at **constant stakeweight** until you choose to **initiate an unlock**.

Once unlocking begins, your stakeweight **decays linearly** over the selected duration until your tokens become withdrawable.

---

### How do I unstake or exit?

You can exit anytime by **initiating an unlocking period**.

Select one of the available durations (e.g., 4, 26, or 52 weeks).

During this time, stakeweight and rewards gradually decrease.

When the period ends, your tokens become **fully withdrawable**.

---

### Which unlock durations are available?

You can choose from predefined options:

**4, 8, 12, 26, 52, 78, or 104 weeks** (≈ 1–24 months).

Shorter unlocks provide flexibility; longer ones grant higher rewards.

---

### How are rewards calculated and distributed?

Rewards are distributed **weekly** (Thursday–Thursday) based on your **share of total stakeweight**:

$$
\text{Reward Share} = \frac{\text{Position Stakeweight}}{\text{Total Network Stakeweight}}
$$

Positions created or updated after Thursday 00:00 GMT become eligible in the **next** reward cycle.

---

### How can I increase my rewards?

You can earn more by:

- Staking **more WCT**
- Choosing a **longer unlock duration**
- **Re-staking** your weekly rewards to compound your position
- Keeping your position locked (not unlocking) to maintain full stakeweight

---

### What happens if I don’t claim rewards immediately?

Unclaimed rewards **accumulate automatically** and can be claimed anytime.

There’s **no expiry** or penalty for delayed claiming.

---

### Can I partially unstake my position?

No. Partial unstaking is **not supported** — you must withdraw the full position once it’s fully unlocked.

---

### Can I change or extend my staking position?

Yes. While locked, you can:

- **Add more WCT** to your existing position
- **Change your unlock preset** to a longer duration

Both actions update your stakeweight accordingly.

Changes made mid-week take effect in the **next reward period**.

---

### Are there any fees?

Only regular **gas fees** apply for on-chain transactions such as staking, updating, claiming, or unstaking.

The cost depends on current network conditions.

---

### Can I have multiple staking positions?

Each address can hold **one active position**.

If you want multiple positions with different durations, use multiple wallet accounts or addresses.

---

### Can locked tokens participate in staking?

Yes. Certain locked allocations (e.g., team or contributor tokens) can be staked and earn rewards even while non-transferable, under their original vesting terms.

<Warning>
  This applies only to long-term allocation contracts.
</Warning>

---

### What happens after my unlock finishes?

When the unlock period ends:

- Your stakeweight and voting power drop to **0**
- You can **withdraw** your full amount
- To continue earning, simply **stake again**
