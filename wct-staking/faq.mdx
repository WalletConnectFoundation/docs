## Frequently Asked Questions

### Are there any fees for staking/unstaking WCT?

Yes, a small gas fee will apply when claiming WCT tokens. The exact amount will depend on blockchain network conditions at the time of claiming.

### Can I join a distribution period mid-week?

Yes, but you'll need to wait until the next distribution period to start receiving rewards. Distribution periods run from Thursday to Thursday, and to be eligible, your position must:

-   Start before Thursday 00:00 GMT
-   Have at least 1 week remaining in the lock period

### How do I receive more rewards?

You can increase your rewards by:

-   Increasing your stakeweight through:
-   Adding more WCT to your position
-   Extending your lock period closer to the maximum (104 weeks)
-   Regularly claiming and restaking your rewards to compound your position
-   Extending your lock period when claiming rewards to maintain optimal stakeweight

### What happens if I miss claiming my rewards?

Your rewards will accumulate and remain available to claim. There's no deadline for claiming rewards, and you won't lose them by not claiming immediately.

### Can I partially unstake my position?

No, partial unstaking is not supported. When unstaking, you must withdraw your entire position.

### What happens to my rewards if my position expires?

Once your position expires:

-   It stops being eligible for new rewards
-   You can still claim any accumulated rewards
-   You'll need to create a new position to continue earning rewards

### Can I have multiple staking positions on one address?

No, you can only have one active staking position at a time per address. You can increase your position by adding more WCT or extend the lock period, but you cannot create multiple separate positions.

### Can locked tokens be staked?

Yes, locked tokens can be staked, even if they are not yet transferable.

These locked tokens are exclusively allocated to core development contributors, early backers, and team members, and are subject to a 4-year unlock schedule, which includes a 1-year cliff starting from the Token Generation Event (TGE).

While these tokens remain non-transferable during the lock-up period, they can still participate in staking and earn rewards.

<Warning>
This applies only to specific long-term allocations.
</Warning>

### Can I update my position mid-week?

Yes, but any updates made mid-week will only take effect starting from the next distribution period. Distribution periods run from Thursday to Thursday, so changes must be in place before Thursday 00:00 GMT to impact the upcoming period.
