## Error Handling

When implementing Chain Abstraction, you may encounter different types of errors. Here's how to handle them effectively:

### Application-Level Errors

These errors (`PrepareError`) indicate specific issues that need to be addressed and typically require user action:

- **Insufficient Gas Fees**: User needs to add more gas tokens to their wallet
- **Malformed Transaction Requests**: Transaction parameters are invalid or incomplete
- **Minimum Bridging Amount Not Met**: Currently set at $0.60
- **Invalid Token or Network Selection**: Selected token or network is not supported

When handling these errors, you should display clear, user-friendly error messages that provide specific guidance on how to resolve the issue. Allow users to modify their transaction parameters and consider implementing validation checks before initiating transactions.

### Retryable Errors

These errors (`Result::Err`) indicate temporary issues that may be resolved by retrying the operation. 
Examples of these types of issues include network connection timeouts, TLS negotiation issues, service outages, or other transient errors.

For retryable errors, show a generic "oops" message to users and provide a retry button. Log detailed error information to your error tracking service, but avoid displaying technical details to end users.

<Note>
For errors in the `execute()` method, a retry may not resolve the issue. In such cases, allow users to cancel the transaction, return them to the application, and let the application initiate a new transaction.
</Note>

### Critical Errors

Critical errors indicate bugs or implementation issues that should be treated as high-priority incidents: incorrect usage of WalletKit API, wrong data encoding or wrong fields passed to WalletKit, or WalletKit internal bugs.
