Wallets enable users to manage their blockchain keys and interact with applications via the WalletConnect protocol. They play a vital role in the Network by enabling end-users to securely access and utilize blockchain services on any network. Wallets are responsible for integrating with the WalletConnect Network and providing a seamless user experience for managing digital assets and performing blockchain transactions. Today, reown provides the WalletKit SDK to enable simple integrations for wallets to the Network.
## Certified Wallets

The [WalletConnect Certified](https://walletconnect.com/blog/walletguide-and-walletconnect-certified-the-future-of-digital-wallets) program offers additional incentives for wallets that meet high standards of UX and integration, further encouraging wallets to stay up-to-date with the latest network features and best practices​.

## Wallet Rewards

Wallets participating in the WalletConnect network can earn rewards through staking and performance incentives. To qualify, wallets must stake WCT tokens, which enables them to participate in the Network's governance and earn staking rewards. 

For a closer look at the WalletConnect network's wallet rewards system, refer to the [Wallet Rewards](/token-dynamics/wallet-rewards) documentation.​
