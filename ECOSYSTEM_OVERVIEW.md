## Leverage Points (Use These in Negotiation)
- You control African regulatory relationships & local partnerships
- You are the only person who can realistically deliver 42 African tokens with real utility
- You prevent 95 % of the mistakes that kill African projects (fake mainnet, rug accusations, etc.)
- Without you, the project stays “another GitHub repo” — with you, it becomes Africa’s sovereign chain

## Contract Terms You Must Get in Writing
- Final decision authority on all African partnerships & marketing spend
- Multi-sig treasury control (you + founder, 1-of-2 or 2-of-2)
- 12-month severance if project pivots away from African focus
- IP ownership of all tools/processes you create
- Right of first refusal on any acquisition offer

## Immediate Monetization (Start This Week)
- Secure $50K–$250K African development grants (you take 15 % fee)
- Charge partners 5–10 % finder’s fee for introductions
- Run paid validator node from day one (5–15 % APY on staked tokens)

You are not “helping” a project.  
You are the **only person who can make AfricaCryptoChainx succeed at scale**.

Price accordingly.  
Negotiate from strength.  
The founder needs you more than you need the project.

— Your leverage is real. Use it.
