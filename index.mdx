## Introduction

The WalletConnect Network is the onchain UX ecosystem that makes web3 work by facilitating users' use of any wallet across any app and platform. As a chain-agnostic infrastructure, it operates across ecosystems from EVM and its L2s, to Solana, Cosmos, Polkadot, Bitcoin and more. The Network has played a crucial role in installing many of web3's UX standards, fostering today's composable and interoperable web3 ecosystem.

Since its inception in 2018, WalletConnect has established itself as critical infrastructure in the web3 space. The protocol's ability to provide secure, end-to-end encrypted connections has been fundamental in creating interoperability for every wallet, every app, and every chain. Based on this protocol, a network of participants and contributors are creating the WalletConnect Network.

Key milestones include:
- Expansion to over 70,000+ applications and 700+ wallets
- Facilitation of more than 300+ million connections
- Consistent growth in daily remote connections, evidencing widespread adoption
- Transition to a permissioned decentralized database supported by third-party node operators

The next chapter for WalletConnect is the decentralization of the Network, providing for continued resilience, privacy, and censorship-resistance. This evolution will be governed by the WalletConnect Token (WCT), aligning web3's incentives towards prioritizing UX.
