## Upgrade to Reown WalletKit

This document outlines the steps to migrate from the old `WalletConnect.Web3Wallet` package to the new `Reown.WalletKit` package in your .NET project.

### Step 1. Replace the corresponding dependency in your project file

```xml
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">

    <!-- ... -->

  <ItemGroup>
/* highlight-delete-start */
    <PackageReference Include="WalletConnect.Web3Wallet" Version="2.4.2" />
/* highlight-delete-end */
/* highlight-add-start */
    <PackageReference Include="Reown.WalletKit" Version="1.0.0" />
/* highlight-add-end */
  </ItemGroup>

</Project>
```

Alternatively, you can use the .NET CLI:

```bash
# Remove the old package
dotnet remove package WalletConnect.Web3Wallet

# Add the new package
dotnet add package Reown.WalletKit
```

### Step 2. Update references to the namespaces

<Table
  headers={["Old", "New"]}
  data={[
    {
      old: { code: "WalletConnectSharp.Web3Wallet" },
      new: { code: "Reown.WalletKit" },
    },
    {
      old: { code: "WalletConnectSharp.Sign" },
      new: { code: "Reown.Sign" },
    },
    {
      old: { code: "WalletConnectSharp.Core" },
      new: { code: "Reown.Core" },
    },
    {
      old: { code: "WalletConnectSharp.Storage" },
      new: { code: "Reown.Core.Storage" },
    },
    {
      old: { code: "WalletConnectSharp.Crypto" },
      new: { code: "Reown.Core.Crypto" },
    },
    {
      old: { code: "WalletConnectSharp.Network" },
      new: { code: "Reown.Core.Network" },
    },
  ]}
/>

### Step 3. Update references to the classes

<Table
  headers={["Old", "New"]}
  data={[
    {
      old: { code: "WalletConnectCore" },
      new: { code: "CoreClient" },
    },
    {
      old: { code: "WalletConnectSignClient" },
      new: { code: "SignClient" },
    },
    {
      old: { code: "Web3WalletClient" },
      new: { code: "WalletKitClient" },
    },
    {
      old: { code: "WCLogger" },
      new: { code: "ReownLogger" },
    },
  ]}
/>

### Final notes

- Ensure that you have updated all relevant configurations and imports in your project to reflect the changes from Web3Wallet to WalletKit.
- Test your application thoroughly to ensure that the migration has been successful and that all functionality is working as expected.
