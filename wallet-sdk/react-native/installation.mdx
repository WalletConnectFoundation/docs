Install the WalletKit package.

```sh
yarn add @reown/walletkit @walletconnect/react-native-compat
```

Additionally add these extra packages to help with async storage, polyfills and the instance of ethers.

```sh
yarn add @react-native-async-storage/async-storage @react-native-community/netinfo react-native-get-random-values fast-text-encoding
```

<Accordion title="Additional setup for Expo">

npx expo install expo-application
```

For those using Typescript, we recommend adding these dev dependencies:

```sh
yarn add @walletconnect/jsonrpc-types --dev
```
