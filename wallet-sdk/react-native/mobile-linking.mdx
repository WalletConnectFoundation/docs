## Usage

Mobile Linking allows your wallet to automatically redirect back to the Dapp allowing for less user interactions and hence a better UX for your users.

### Establishing Communication Between Mobile Wallets and Apps

When integrating a wallet with a mobile application, it's essential to understand how they communicate. The process involves two main steps:

1. **QR Code Handshake:** The mobile app (Dapp) generates a unique URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) and displays it as a QR code. This URI acts like a secret handshake. When the user scans the QR code using their wallet app, they establish a connection. It's like saying, "Hey, let's chat!"
2. **Deep Links and Universal Links:** The URI from the QR code allows the wallet app to create a [deep link](https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/10023042?hl=en#:~:text=Deep%20links%20send%20mobile%20device,%2C%20Shopping%2C%20and%20Display%20campaigns.) or [universal link](https://developer.apple.com/ios/universal-links/). These links work on both Android and iOS. They enable seamless communication between the wallet and the app.

<Tip>

**Developers should prefer Deep Linking over Universal Linking.**

Universal Linking may redirect the user to a browser, which might not provide the intended user experience. Deep Linking ensures the user is taken directly to the app.

### Key Behavior to Address

In some scenarios, wallets use redirect metadata provided in session proposals to open applications. This can cause unintended behavior, such as:

Redirecting to the wrong app when multiple apps share the same redirect metadata (e.g., a desktop and mobile version of the same Dapp).
Opening an unrelated application if a QR code is scanned on a different device than where the wallet is installed.

#### Recommended Approach

To avoid this behavior, wallets should:

- **Restrict Redirect Metadata to Deep Link Use Cases**: Redirect metadata should only be used when the session proposal is initiated through a deep link. QR code scans should not trigger app redirects using session proposal metadata.

The connection and sign request flows are similar across platforms.

### Connection Flow

- **Dapp Prompts User:** The Dapp asks the user to connect.
- **User Chooses Wallet:** The user selects a wallet from a list of compatible wallets.
- **Redirect to Wallet:** The user is redirected to their chosen wallet.
- **Wallet Approval:** The wallet prompts the user to approve or reject the session (similar to granting permission).
- **Return to Dapp:**
  - **Manual Return:** The wallet asks the user to manually return to the Dapp.
  - **Automatic Return:** Alternatively, the wallet automatically takes the user back to the Dapp.
- **User Reunites with Dapp:** After all the interactions, the user ends up back in the Dapp.

### Sign Request Flow

When the Dapp needs the user to sign something (like a transaction), a similar pattern occurs:

- **Automatic Redirect:** The Dapp automatically sends the user to their previously chosen wallet.
- **Approval Prompt:** The wallet asks the user to approve or reject the request.
- **Return to Dapp:**
  - **Manual Return:** The wallet asks the user to manually return to the Dapp.
  - **Automatic Return:** Alternatively, the wallet automatically takes the user back to the Dapp.
- **User Reconnects:** Eventually, the user returns to the Dapp.

## Platform preparations

Since React Native leverages on native APIs, you must follow iOS and Android steps for each native platform

More information in official documentation: https://reactnative.dev/docs/linking?syntax=android#enabling-deep-links

<Tip>

Dapps developers must do the same for their own custom schemes if they want the wallet to be able to navigate back after a session approval or a sign request response

</Tip>

## Integration

In order to redirect to the Dapp, you'll need to use `Linking` from `react-native` and call `openURL()` method with the Dapp scheme that comes in the proposal metadata.

```js
import { Linking } from "react-native";

async function onApprove(proposal, namespaces) {
  const session = await walletKit.approveSession({
    id: proposal.id,
    namespaces,
  });

  const dappScheme = session.peer.metadata.redirect?.native;

  if (dappScheme) {
    Linking.openURL(dappScheme);
  } else {
    // Inform the user to manually return to the DApp
  }
}
```
