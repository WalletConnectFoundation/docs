Security is a fundamental aspect of the WalletConnect architecture. The infrastructure has undergone multiple rounds of third-party security reviews, audits, penetration testing, and threat modeling to ensure the highest standards of protection. Security is viewed as a continuously evolving discipline, with regular system audits to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.

## Wallet SDK

### Architecture

The Wallet SDK provides an end-to-end encrypted solution for wallets to connect to applications and sign messages/transactions. As an open-source SDK, it supports multiple transport methods, from WebSockets to Universal Links.

### Handshake & End-to-End Encryption

For a detailed overview of the handshake and end-to-end encryption protocol, refer to the [technical specification](https://specs.walletconnect.com/2.0/specs/clients/sign/session-proposal).

### Audits

The Wallet SDK, including its encryption stack, was audited by Trail of Bits. The audit report is available [here](https://github.com/trailofbits/publications/blob/master/reviews/2023-03-walletconnectv2-securityreview.pdf). This comprehensive security review covered the source code and included a lightweight Threat Model covering upstream and downstream dependencies. The broader WalletConnect system underwent Threat Modeling by Spearbit. The threat model is available [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QpPSLvCEMunaYHHBPN0g6kYd39uFxpPk/view).

### Dependencies

The Wallet SDK's design philosophy prioritizes minimizing third-party dependencies to reduce the attack surface area.

## Third-Party Reviews

The security infrastructure of WalletConnect has undergone multiple rounds of audits by independent security auditing firms, including Trail of Bits, Halborn, and Spearbit.
